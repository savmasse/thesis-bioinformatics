\chapter*{Preface}

First and foremost I would to thank the VIB for giving me access to their infrastructure during this project. I would also like to thank my promoter prof. Yves Van de Peer, and especially my supervisor Arthur Zwaenepoel for his invaluable help in correctly setting up Julia with the Beluga and Whale libraries. 
\\
Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me throughout the year.
