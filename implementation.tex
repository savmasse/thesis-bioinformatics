\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Notes on the state of the art}
At the start of this project there were no publicly available Julia packages that implemented the variational inference techniques studied here. However, since then there have been developments in the field. The Turing.jl package, a general-purpose probabilistic programming library, now has an ADVI implementation and plans to add others \parencite{Turing}; although this is not yet available in the current stable release version.

\section{Notes on the accompanying package PhyloVI}
A variational inference library written in the Julia language called PhyloVI is available on GitHub at \textit{www.github.com/savmasse/PhyloVI}. It contains all code relevant to this thesis project; both the implementation of the algorithms and the code used to generate the plots for this document. PhyloVI was written in Julia 1.3 and is not guaranteed to function in any other version of Julia.
